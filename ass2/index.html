    <h3 style="color:#101042">Total Fatalities Per State</h3>
    <p>Observing the data shown by the map, western side states prove to have <span style="font-weight: bold;">more fatalities</span> when it comes to road incidents.<br>
      A large reason why this is the case is because of the denser populations in these regions compared to the other states.<br>
      Which follows through on current estimates based on population.gov.au (NSW: 8,189,266, VIC: 6,649,159, QLD: 5,221,170.)<br>
      This also allows a conlusion to made that <span style="font-weight: bold;">denser populations lead to greater fatalities </span>or proportionate to the population.<br>

    <div class="column">
      <div class="middle-div" style="padding-top: 20px;">
        <p>The heat map indicates the spread of monthly fatalities in a year. It can be observed that during the quartely holiday periods <span style="font-weight: heavy;">greater fatalities</span> occur.<br>
          This is expected as roads become more dense and there is higher probability that these <span style="font-weight: bold;">festive </span> periods have drug influenced accidents as well such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">alcohol </span> and other substances.<br>
          However, further looking at the time-series we can months have also began to shift in total crashes as well.<br>
          We can see this in October and November from 1989 to 1990 in which October became less incident prone after the years which indicate that policies in <span style="font-weight: bold;">road safety or general safety was improving</span>.<br>

    <p>Further anaylsis made into the gender specifics another conclusion can be made that the male gender has<br> been involved in <span style="font-weight: bold;">drasitically more </span>number of fatal incidents compared to women. <br>
      Looking at the age brackets as well there can be another conclusion made that number generous have through the years <br>been at <span style="font-weight: bold;">greater risk </span>of fatal road incidents. Which can be assumed true from the lack of experience<br>

    Pedestrains are also a big group factor when it comes to incidents and compared to groups such as passengers,<br> the rate of decline in this diagram the rate of shrinkage in bubble size compared to the others.<br>
    Same with Motorcycle groups, these groups can be anaylzed as having <span style="font-weight: bold;">no little to none improvement in safety</span> after 30 years of improvement.
